##Assumptions of whole developing process:
1) to create automatic mechanism to auto-fill from Omdb API (with one request from my app) all Box Office values in database, cause it was needed to use in my tasks but csv file did not provide me this data - it is not in 100% perfectly completed, but for this challenge (for tests) works properly :)
2) to make the app simple to run, so I decided to use Docker which was my first experience when creating Dockerfile and build .jar in Container
3) to prepare fine and ready to tests database
4) to calculate precise average rating of movie - done in my opinion well
5) also to have fun as always and learn something new :)
