The web application application is created with Java 11, Spring Boot, Maven, MySQL, Docker. Provded API allows user to check if selected movie was awarded with Oscar. It also allows to rate movie and search for top-ten rated movie in database. But first step for User is to get all box office values, cause database do not provide this data. It takes only 20 seconds, but then user can work with those three functionalities. I decided for this solution to try handle interesting issue, when working with not-well formatted and prepared database. The rest is regular and simple (in my opinion) standard solutions provided by Spring Boot. I also used ConfigProperties (@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "consts")) to store in **application.yml** couple of constants values. Primary const value is "Best Picture", cause I deal with whole database but i used only 485 records from this category. I imported .csv into MySQL, then prepared couple records (11) for easily to reviewer test getting top-10 rated movies, in the end made dump and put into resources to run with docker-compose. Also I swapped values between two columns in some cases (bugs in .csv file) - see **swapped_values.png**. Also I formatted .csv file - I removed redundant columns. I wrote javadocs to explain methods in services.
